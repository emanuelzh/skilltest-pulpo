# Vagrant Ubuntu 16 Boilerplate

This is a repo I use to begin a clean Ubuntu 16 machine with some common packages for PHP Development. 

I know is already the Homestead stack but I hate complexity and I like to do stuff by myself.

It is required to install [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) plugin to automagically install/update the vbguest stuff.

```bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```
